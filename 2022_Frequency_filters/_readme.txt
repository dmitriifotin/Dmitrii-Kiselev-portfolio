A hardware-only system designed to take an audio input through an AUX port, split it into frequency ranges and visually show the input frequencies

This is an electrical-only project where the team had to design a set of 5 filters in order to separate an input audio signal into ranges of frequencies. The goal was to become familiar with low-pass, bandpass and high-pass filter design as well as with the reiterative design process due to initial tests showing poor accuracy.
The separated frequencies were shown on 5 LED ladders of 10 LEDs each, aka a physical representation of an equalizer.
