Code-only backend architecture with console UI for making movie ticket orders out of the given options with the admin interface to add screenings (none of the data is hardcoded)

The UI is split into two parts: admin to create screenings, created dates/times, adjust theater size, adjust snack/drink options, add promo codes, blacklist customers and adjust/remove existing ticket entries.
The goal of the project was to implement separate functions and separate files for functions and variables, as well keep a record of all interactions between software uses, so the program doesn't start from scratch each time it's launched. A good amount of string parsing/formatting and algorithm design to implement all the listed functionality.
