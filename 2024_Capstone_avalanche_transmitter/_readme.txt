A transmitter-only device for short-range detection of avalanche victims

The goal was to design a transmitter that would be more affordable than the existing transceiver devices on the market. The device had to be compliant with the ETSI and FCC regulations with regards to the frequency, range, modulation, protection against shock and weather, and battery life.
The project was split into sections, with each team member responsible for one design aspect. My responsibility was to design the schematic and the PCB, which required some research into tying the MCU, frequency generator and antenna together.

MCU: Adafruit Pro Trinket
Script: n/a
Components: Adafruit Pro Trinket, Si5351A frequency generator, antenna assembled from scratch for the specific frequency requirements.

Timeline: 5 months
Team role: schematic and PCB design + signal amplifier circuit (not used in the final design)
