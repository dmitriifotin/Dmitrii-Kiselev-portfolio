ARM processor onboard LED cycle

The goal of the project was to get used to the research process, especially for more hardware-level setups.
The requirement was to make the BEAGL-BONE-BLACK onboard LEDs blink in a sequence. This is an ARM processor, which needed to be programmed with assembly, so the algorithm is less straightforward. The biggest task was to determine the setup requirements, registers and data written to the registers in order to make the LEDs blink. Otherwise, it was just a loop script.
The second part of the project introduces a button interrupt as an exercise on implementing interrupts in assembly.
