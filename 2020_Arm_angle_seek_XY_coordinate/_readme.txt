Single-joint robot arm that seeks fastest path to reaching the given X/Y coordinates

The code determines the required angles for the shoulder and elbow.
Unfortunately, the code was lost, but the most challenging part of the project was not the code, but determining the equations needed to convert the given coordinates into joint angles. The demo goes over the general math concepts, test results and possible sources of error.
