Handheld arcade game with an exploding capacitor upon loss

An intro project to our senior year capstone, the goal was to get familiar with reports/documentation to maintain for the actual capstone.
The project itself is a snake game (code sourced from elsewhere) on a display and an attached capacitor in a safe compartment that explodes if the player loses. The capacitor then has to be replaced in order to play again.
